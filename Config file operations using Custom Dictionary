"""
 We are in need of a configuration file which happens to have data in the form of key vaue pairs inside it , like 'Email' = 'hkbiet@gmail.com'.
 We've got to be able to write keys and respective values in the config file and also be able to retrieve the values of key asked for .

 Hence , The best way to go around is to create a custom dictionary , which writes key value pairs to the configuration file and retrieves data as va- -lue for key asked for
